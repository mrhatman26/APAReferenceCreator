# APAReferenceCreator
A Python program that allows you to quickly input information about a source and get a (hopefully) real APA reference for it.

You chose between a book reference, journal reference and a website reference and then enter the information required which should then give you a reference for it so you don't have to write it yourself. (It's kind of pointless, I know)
